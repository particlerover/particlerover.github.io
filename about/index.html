				I am an Astronomy PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park
				by the CRESST II collaboration at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center, working on the
				FIR balloon experiment, EXCLAIM. I am from the Philadelphia area, though my family
				lived for several years in London, UK. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Physics
				(with an astronomy specialization) from the University of Chicago in 2017, and my
				master's in Astronomy from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2020. </p> -->

				   boating, and hiking with my dog, Hubble. Feel free to reach out about any
				   science outreach or art collaboration opportunities.</p>
